# XGBoost Model Deployment on Amazon SageMaker

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to train an XGBoost model, fine-tune its hyperparameters, and deploy it using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. The primary goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model in a production-ready environment.

## Contents
