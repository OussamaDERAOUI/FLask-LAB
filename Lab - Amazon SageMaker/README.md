# XGBoost Model Deployment on Amazon SageMaker

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to train an XGBoost model, fine-tune its hyperparameters, and deploy it using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. The primary goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model in a production-ready environment.

## Contents

- **xgboost.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook covering:
  - Dataset loading and preprocessing
  - Splitting data into training/validation sets
  - Hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost
  - Uploading datasets to Amazon S3
  - Setting up XGBoost estimator in SageMaker
  - Model training and deployment
  - Making predictions using the deployed model

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- An AWS account with SageMaker and S3 permissions
- Access to a Jupyter Notebook environment

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Open and Run the Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `xgboost.ipynb`.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook xgboost.ipynb
    ```

3. **Follow the Notebook Steps**: Execute each cell in the notebook, following the instructions provided.

4. **Exploring Deployed Model**: After deployment, explore making predictions using the deployed endpoint and understand the deployment configurations.

## Cleanup

After completion, ensure to clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs:
- Stop or delete the SageMaker endpoint
- Delete any unused S3 buckets
