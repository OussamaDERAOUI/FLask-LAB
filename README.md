### Decision Tree Model Deployment for Water Potability

This project is a web application designed to predict the potability of water based on specific water quality parameters. It utilizes a decision tree machine learning model to make predictions. Users can input values for water hardness, sulfate concentration, conductivity, and organic carbon content via a user-friendly HTML form. Upon submission, the model processes the inputs and provides a binary prediction, indicating whether the water is potable (safe to drink) or non-potable.
